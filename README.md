<h1 align="center">Hi ðŸ‘‹, I'm Francisco Silva</h1>
<h4 align="center"> style="font-weight: normal;">I attended the LycÃ©e FranÃ§ais Charles Lepierre in Lisbon, where I learned four languages (Portuguese, French, English and Spanish), and I am currently learning German. I am in the second year of my bachelorâ€™s degree in Computer Engineering at Instituto Superior TÃ©cnico in Lisbon, a member of the Student Association (AE), and a member of the TÃ©cnico Security Team. Additionally, I am passionate about entrepreneurship and have been involved in several small projects, the largest being my event promotion company, Lunar Events.

I have a big gaming experience in my teenage years, which allowed me to have a deeper understanding of that field. I also ran a YouTube channel where I published gameplay videos, which allowed me to gain experience in video and image editing.

In terms of programming, I have experience with Python, C, C++, Java, Prolog, Assembly, and I am eager to learn new technologies. You can find several projects I have built here on my GitHub</h4>
